                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I

                    joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                      I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                      I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                      people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
                      the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I
                      enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the
                      best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                      completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
                      working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

                      Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
                      code. I needed some structure from professionals who can
                      help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged
                      to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
                      wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
                      and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and
                      I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                      project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
                      learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could
                      ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
                      interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
                      certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
                      after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!
